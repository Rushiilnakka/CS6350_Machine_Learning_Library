# Linear Regression
This implements a batch gradient, stochastic gradient descent, calculate the optimal weight vector.
# Commands
To run the batch gradient descent algorithm on concrete dataset:
python3 (HW_2_4a.ipynb, 

To run the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on concrete dataset:
python3 HW_2_4b_4c.ipynb, 

To run the calculate the optimal weight vector on concrete dataset:
python3 HW_2_4b_4c.ipynb

#In question 4a,4b,4c (HW_2_4a.ipynb, HW_2_4b_4c.ipynb, HW_2_4b_4c.ipynb)

The dataset location has to be updated, as the location given is the local folder location. Here bank dataset has to be used.
# Load data
