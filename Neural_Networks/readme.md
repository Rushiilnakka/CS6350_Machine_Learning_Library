# Neural network
This implements a three-layer artificial neural network.
# Commands
To run the back-propogation algorithm on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_2a.ipynb

To run the stochaistic gradient descent algorithm on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_2b.ipynb

To run the training algorithm where all the weights are initialized with 0 on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_2c.ipynb

To run the algorithm using PyTorch on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_2e.ipynb

The dataset location has to be updated, as the location given is the local folder location. Here bank-note dataset has to be used.
