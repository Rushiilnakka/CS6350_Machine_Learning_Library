# Logistic Regression
This implements a logistic Regression model with stochastic gradient descent.
# Commands
To run the MAP estimation on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_3a.ipynb

To run the maximum likelihood(ML) estimation on bank-note dataset:
jupyter notebook HW_5_3b.ipynb

The dataset location has to be updated, as the location given is the local folder location. Here bank-note dataset has to be used.
# Load data
